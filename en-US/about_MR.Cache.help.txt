SYNOPSIS
    ScriptBlock-based cache with TTL, statistics and hash indexing.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    MR.Cache provides a lightweight, ScriptBlock-based caching mechanism
    for PowerShell. Results of ScriptBlocks are cached under a defined key
    and can be reused until their time-to-live (TTL) expires.

    The module is designed to improve performance for expensive or repetitive
    operations, such as network queries, directory lookups, or API calls.

COMMANDS
    Use-MRCache
        Executes a ScriptBlock using the cache. Returns cached results
        when available, otherwise computes and stores the result.

    Clear-MRCache
        Removes entries from the cache. Optionally clears a specific key.

    Get-MRCacheStats
        Returns cache statistics such as hits, misses and entry count.

EXAMPLES
    Import the module:

        Import-Module MR.Cache

    Cache a value with a TTL of 30 seconds:

        Use-MRCache -Key 'DhcpLeases' -TtlSeconds 30 -ScriptBlock { Get-Data }

    Clear the entire cache:

        Clear-MRCache
